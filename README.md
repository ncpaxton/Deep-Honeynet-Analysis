# Deep Honeynet Analysis
Teach RNNs to identify the difference between honeynet data and normal traffic so we can predict malicious attempts on a network.

In this project we will generate three datasets. Each data set will be labeled based on the type of traffic
(1) Normal traffic
(2) Honeynet based IoT traffic
(3) Honeynet based Web Application Traffic

We will combine the datasets and select a 80/10/10 split between training/ development/ testing

Our goal is to predict what type of data is being captured. Successful completion of this project will provide security practitioners information on specific threats to a network. They can then tailor a defense based on those specific threats.
